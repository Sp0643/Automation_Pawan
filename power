To filter data, group by question type, and show correct and wrong scores by question type in Power Apps, you can use a combination of `Filter`, `GroupBy`, `AddColumns`, and `Sum` functions. Here's an approach to achieve this:

### Assumptions:
- You have a data source named `QuizResponses` with columns: `QuestionType`, `IsCorrect` (where `true` represents correct answers and `false` represents wrong answers).
- You want to group by `QuestionType` and calculate the count of correct and wrong scores.

### Step-by-Step Code:

1. **Filter and Group Data:**
   - Use the `GroupBy` function to group the data by `QuestionType`.

2. **Calculate Correct and Wrong Scores:**
   - Use `AddColumns` to add columns for the count of correct and wrong answers.

Here's the complete code:

```PowerApps
// Step 1: Group data by QuestionType
ClearCollect(
    GroupedData,
    AddColumns(
        GroupBy(
            QuizResponses,
            "QuestionType",
            "GroupedItems"
        ),
        "CorrectScore",
        Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = true), 1),
        "WrongScore",
        Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = false), 1)
    )
)
```

### Explanation:
- **`GroupBy(QuizResponses, "QuestionType", "GroupedItems")`**: Groups the `QuizResponses` table by `QuestionType` and stores the grouped records in `GroupedItems`.
- **`AddColumns(...)`**: Adds new columns to calculate the correct and wrong scores.
- **`Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = true), 1)`**: Sums the count of correct answers within each group.
- **`Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = false), 1)`**: Sums the count of wrong answers within each group.

This approach will create a collection (`GroupedData`) that shows the `QuestionType` along with `CorrectScore` and `WrongScore` for each question type, which you can then display in a gallery or any other control in Power Apps.


To get the correct and wrong answers marks by question types in Power Apps using Power FX, you can use a combination of `Filter`, `Sum`, and `GroupBy` functions to process the data. Assuming you have a SharePoint list or a collection (`Responses`) that contains user responses with the fields `UserID`, `QuestionType`, `IsCorrect` (boolean indicating if the answer is correct), and `Marks`, here is a sample Power FX code:

### 1. Grouping Responses by Question Type
First, group the responses by `QuestionType`:

```PowerFx
// Group responses by QuestionType
ClearCollect(
    GroupedResponses,
    GroupBy(
        Responses,
        "QuestionType",
        "QuestionData"
    )
);
```

### 2. Calculate Correct and Wrong Marks for Each Group
For each grouped question type, calculate the marks for correct and wrong answers:

```PowerFx
// Calculate correct and wrong marks for each question type
ClearCollect(
    QuestionMarksSummary,
    AddColumns(
        GroupedResponses,
        "CorrectMarks",
        Sum(
            Filter(
                QuestionData,
                IsCorrect = true
            ),
            Marks
        ),
        "WrongMarks",
        Sum(
            Filter(
                QuestionData,
                IsCorrect = false
            ),
            Marks
        )
    )
);
```

### Explanation:
- `GroupBy` groups the responses by `QuestionType`.
- `AddColumns` is used to add `CorrectMarks` and `WrongMarks` for each group.
- `Sum` calculates the total marks for correct and wrong answers within each question type.

This code will create a collection `QuestionMarksSummary` with each question type and the corresponding marks for correct and wrong answers. Let me know if you need further adjustments or clarifications!


// Create a joined collection using outer join
ClearCollect(JoinedCollection,
    ForAll(
        Union(
            ForAll(AugCollection, {user_kid: user_kid, aug_score: aug_score, sep_score: LookUp(SepCollection, user_kid = AugCollection[@user_kid], sep_score)}),
            ForAll(SepCollection, {user_kid: user_kid, aug_score: LookUp(AugCollection, user_kid = SepCollection[@user_kid], aug_score), sep_score: sep_score})
        ),
        {
            user_kid: user_kid,
            aug_score: If(IsBlank(aug_score), 0, aug_score),
            sep_score: If(IsBlank(sep_score), 0, sep_score)
        }
    )
);


To join the two collections based on the KID (user ID) and ensure that all KIDs are included with appropriate handling of missing scores (i.e., replacing missing scores with zero), you can use the AddColumns, Lookup, and Collect functions in Power Apps. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Sample Collections

Let's assume your collections are as follows:

Collection1 (AugustScores):

KID

AugustScore


Collection2 (SeptemberScores):

KID

SeptemberScore



Step 2: Combine the Collections

To create a combined collection that includes all unique KIDs from both collections, you need to merge the collections first:

// Step 1: Combine the unique KIDs from both collections
ClearCollect(
    CombinedKIDs,
    Distinct(AugustScores, KID),
    Distinct(SeptemberScores, KID)
);

Step 3: Create the Final Collection with Scores

Now, create a final collection that joins these KIDs with their respective scores from both collections. Missing scores will be replaced with zero.

// Step 2: Create the final collection with scores
ClearCollect(
    FinalCollection,
    AddColumns(
        CombinedKIDs,
        "AugustScore",
        If(
            !IsBlank(Lookup(AugustScores, KID = Result).AugustScore),
            Lookup(AugustScores, KID = Result).AugustScore,
            0
        ),
        "SeptemberScore",
        If(
            !IsBlank(Lookup(SeptemberScores, KID = Result).SeptemberScore),
            Lookup(SeptemberScores, KID = Result).SeptemberScore,
            0
        )
    )
);

Explanation:

1. CombinedKIDs: Merges the distinct KIDs from both collections to ensure all users are included.


2. FinalCollection: Adds columns for August and September scores by looking up each KID in the respective collections. If the score is missing, it assigns zero.



The resulting FinalCollection will have the following structure:

KID

AugustScore (or 0 if not present)

SeptemberScore (or 0 if not present)

To trigger an email through Power Apps, you can use the Office 365 Outlook connector, which allows sending emails programmatically from Power Apps. Here's how you can implement this:

Steps to send an email:

1. Add the Outlook Connector:

In your Power Apps, click on Data from the left menu.

Click on Add Data and search for Office 365 Outlook.

Add the Office 365 Outlook connector to your app.



2. Create a Button or an Action:

Add a button or define the event where you want the email to be triggered (like after form submission or when a user clicks on a button).



3. Use the Office365Outlook.SendEmailV2 Function:

In the OnSelect property of the button, you can write the following formula:


Office365Outlook.SendEmailV2(
    "recipient@example.com", // Replace with the recipient's email address
    "Email Subject",          // Replace with your subject
    "Email Body",             // Replace with your email body
    {
        Importance: "Normal",
        IsHtml: true
    }
)

You can also include dynamic data by concatenating the text or adding form field values.


For example:

Office365Outlook.SendEmailV2(
    TextInputEmail.Text,    // Fetching the email from a text input control
    "Quiz Results",         // Subject
    "Hello " & TextInputName.Text & ", your quiz score is " & QuizScore & ".", // Dynamic email body
    {
        Importance: "Normal",
        IsHtml: false
    }
)



Optional Enhancements:

You can include CC or BCC by adding more parameters.

Attachments can be added by specifying a file reference in the attachments parameter.


This will allow you to send an email directly from Power Apps when a certain event or button is triggered.
