To filter data, group by question type, and show correct and wrong scores by question type in Power Apps, you can use a combination of `Filter`, `GroupBy`, `AddColumns`, and `Sum` functions. Here's an approach to achieve this:

### Assumptions:
- You have a data source named `QuizResponses` with columns: `QuestionType`, `IsCorrect` (where `true` represents correct answers and `false` represents wrong answers).
- You want to group by `QuestionType` and calculate the count of correct and wrong scores.

### Step-by-Step Code:

1. **Filter and Group Data:**
   - Use the `GroupBy` function to group the data by `QuestionType`.

2. **Calculate Correct and Wrong Scores:**
   - Use `AddColumns` to add columns for the count of correct and wrong answers.

Here's the complete code:

```PowerApps
// Step 1: Group data by QuestionType
ClearCollect(
    GroupedData,
    AddColumns(
        GroupBy(
            QuizResponses,
            "QuestionType",
            "GroupedItems"
        ),
        "CorrectScore",
        Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = true), 1),
        "WrongScore",
        Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = false), 1)
    )
)
```

### Explanation:
- **`GroupBy(QuizResponses, "QuestionType", "GroupedItems")`**: Groups the `QuizResponses` table by `QuestionType` and stores the grouped records in `GroupedItems`.
- **`AddColumns(...)`**: Adds new columns to calculate the correct and wrong scores.
- **`Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = true), 1)`**: Sums the count of correct answers within each group.
- **`Sum(Filter(GroupedItems, IsCorrect = false), 1)`**: Sums the count of wrong answers within each group.

This approach will create a collection (`GroupedData`) that shows the `QuestionType` along with `CorrectScore` and `WrongScore` for each question type, which you can then display in a gallery or any other control in Power Apps.
