In Alteryx, you can achieve this using a Formula Tool. Here’s how you can create a column that captures which of the three columns have data:

Formula Logic in Alteryx

1. Add a Formula Tool after your input data.


2. Create a new column (e.g., DataPresence).


3. Use the following formula:



Trim(
    IIF(ISNULL([ColumnA]) OR [ColumnA] = "", "", "Column A has data, ") +
    IIF(ISNULL([ColumnB]) OR [ColumnB] = "", "", "Column B has data, ") +
    IIF(ISNULL([ColumnC]) OR [ColumnC] = "", "", "Column C has data, "),
    ", "
)

Explanation:

1. ISNULL([ColumnA]) OR [ColumnA] = "" → Checks if ColumnA is blank or null.


2. If ColumnA has data, it adds "Column A has data, " to the output.


3. Repeats the process for ColumnB and ColumnC.


4. Trim(..., ", ") removes the trailing comma and space at the end.



Example Output:

This will dynamically generate a text column specifying which columns contain data while skipping blanks.

Would you like to add this logic inside a Multi-Field Formula Tool to apply it to multiple columns dynamically?
