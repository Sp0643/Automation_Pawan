Meeting Progress Update - Reconciliation Automation Project

1. Current Progress:

We have successfully created the initial draft of the automation workflow.

This draft was presented to the Planning team for review.


2. Feedback and Next Steps:

Based on the feedback, the logic needs further refinement and evolution.

We have identified two potential approaches for improving the workflow:

a. Rebuilding from Scratch:

Exploring the feasibility of creating a new workflow from scratch that aligns better with the evolving requirements.


b. Enhancing the Existing Workflow:

Utilizing the current workflow and improving its efficiency.

Instead of processing 100% of the data through the automated logic, we'll focus on automating 90% of the data efficiently.

The remaining 10% (which may have exceptions or require special handling) will be managed through Data Analysts (DA) to ensure accuracy.



3. Next Steps:

Assess the pros and cons of both approaches.

Collaborate with stakeholders to finalize the most suitable solution.

Continue refining the workflow to align with business requirements.


Please let me know if you'd like any additional details or adjustments to the pointers.
