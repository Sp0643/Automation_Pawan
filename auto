Here is the Python code for reconciling two DataFrames based on an identifier and creating three resulting DataFrames:

1. Matching DataFrame: Rows that exist in both DataFrames (based on the identifier).


2. Exclusive to First DataFrame: Rows that exist only in the first DataFrame.


3. Exclusive to Second DataFrame: Rows that exist only in the second DataFrame.



import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrames
df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    'identifier': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'value1': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
})

df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    'identifier': [3, 4, 5, 6],
    'value2': ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'W']
})

# Reconciliation process
# 1. Matching DataFrame
matching_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='identifier')

# 2. Exclusive to First DataFrame
exclusive_df1 = df1[~df1['identifier'].isin(df2['identifier'])]

# 3. Exclusive to Second DataFrame
exclusive_df2 = df2[~df2['identifier'].isin(df1['identifier'])]

# Display the results
print("Matching DataFrame:")
print(matching_df)

print("\nExclusive to First DataFrame:")
print(exclusive_df1)

print("\nExclusive to Second DataFrame:")
print(exclusive_df2)

Explanation of the Code:

1. Matching DataFrame:

Use pd.merge() with the on parameter set to the identifier column to find rows that exist in both DataFrames.



2. Exclusive to First DataFrame:

Use the ~ operator along with isin() to filter rows in the first DataFrame that are not in the second DataFrame based on the identifier.



3. Exclusive to Second DataFrame:

Similarly, use ~ with isin() to filter rows in the second DataFrame that are not in the first DataFrame.




You can replace the sample DataFrames (df1 and df2) with your actual DataFrames. Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!
