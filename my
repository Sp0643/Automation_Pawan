Here's a corrected and polished version of your write-up for improved clarity and flow:

This year, I have contributed to multiple key projects and successfully managed and delivered more than 35 BAUs, demonstrating dedication and efficiency across all assigned tasks. These include PKT, GSS, Exception Consolidation Automation, FCC, LIQ WIP Aging, and the Report Migration project.

In the PKT Tool project, I led overall development, scaling efforts, and training of the developer team. In the ongoing Report Migration project, I am migrating reports from SQL Server Report Builder to advanced platforms like Power BI and Alteryx, ensuring a seamless transition to modern reporting tools.

For the Exception Consolidation Automation initiative, I developed an automated workflow that eliminated manual reconciliation tasks, resulting in significant efficiency gains.

Looking ahead, I aim to continue refining my skills in Tableau, SQL, Python, Analytics, GenAI, LLMs, Alteryx, and Power Apps, and to leverage automation to drive more meaningful business insights and contribute to future projects.
