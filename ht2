niGreat! Let's create a Z-test for proportions using your loan dataset. We'll follow a similar example to the one you provided:

Hypothesis Statement

Null Hypothesis (): There is no significant difference in the proportion of loan approvals (Loan_Status) compared to an assumed proportion.

Alternative Hypothesis (): The proportion of loan approvals in the dataset is significantly different from an assumed proportion (e.g., 80% approval rate).


Test Type

One-sample Z-test for proportions (One categorical field: Loan_Status)



---

Python Code for the Z-test

Let’s write the code to test whether the proportion of loan approvals in our dataset is significantly different from 80% (assumed population proportion).

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"  # Replace with the actual file format if needed
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Drop missing values in Loan_Status column
loan_df = loan_df.dropna(subset=['Loan_Status'])

# Convert 'Loan_Status' to binary (1 for approved, 0 for not approved)
loan_df['Loan_Status'] = loan_df['Loan_Status'].map({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})

# Count number of approved loans
success_count = loan_df['Loan_Status'].sum()  # Number of approvals
total_count = loan_df.shape[0]  # Total applications

# Assumed proportion of loan approvals in the population
p0 = 0.80  

# Perform one-sample Z-test for proportion
stat, p_value = proportions_ztest(success_count, total_count, p0, alternative='two-sided')

# Print results
print(f"Test Statistic: {stat:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The proportion of loan approvals is significantly different from 80%.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in loan approval proportion.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Reads the dataset and removes missing values in Loan_Status.

Converts Loan_Status into a binary format (1 = Approved, 0 = Not Approved).

Counts the number of approved loans.



2. Hypothesis Testing

We assume the proportion of approvals in the general population is 80% (p0 = 0.80).

Performs a one-sample Z-test for proportions.

Uses statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest() to compare the sample proportion to 80%.



3. Interpretation

If p-value < 0.05, reject  → The proportion of loan approvals is significantly different from 80%.

Otherwise, fail to reject  → No significant difference.





---

Next Steps

You can change the assumed proportion (p0) based on real-world assumptions.

You can test for gender-based differences in loan approvals using a two-sample Z-test.

Visualizations (bar plots) can help in better understanding the data distribution.


Would you like me to extend this with another hypothesis test or add visualization for better insights?

Chi-Square Test for Independence

The Chi-Square test helps determine whether two categorical variables are independent or have a significant association.


---

Hypothesis Statement

Null Hypothesis (): There is no significant association between Gender and Loan Status (i.e., loan approval is independent of gender).

Alternative Hypothesis (): There is a significant association between Gender and Loan Status (i.e., loan approval depends on gender).



---

Python Code for Chi-Square Test

Now, let’s perform a Chi-Square test of independence using your dataset.

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"  # Adjust if needed
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Drop missing values in Gender and Loan_Status columns
loan_df = loan_df.dropna(subset=['Gender', 'Loan_Status'])

# Create a contingency table for Gender vs Loan_Status
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(loan_df['Gender'], loan_df['Loan_Status'])

# Perform Chi-Square test
chi2_stat, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# Print results
print("Contingency Table:")
print(contingency_table)
print("\nChi-Square Statistic:", chi2_stat)
print("P-value:", p_value)
print("Degrees of Freedom:", dof)
print("\nExpected Frequencies Table:")
print(pd.DataFrame(expected, index=contingency_table.index, columns=contingency_table.columns))

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("\nReject the null hypothesis: Gender and Loan_Status are associated.")
else:
    print("\nFail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant association between Gender and Loan_Status.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Loads the dataset and removes missing values in Gender and Loan_Status.

Constructs a contingency table showing the frequency of each category combination.



2. Chi-Square Test Execution

Uses scipy.stats.chi2_contingency() to compute:

Chi-Square statistic: Measures how much the observed data deviates from expected values.

p-value: Probability of observing the data if  is true.

Degrees of Freedom (dof): (rows - 1) * (columns - 1).

Expected frequencies: What we would expect if there was no relationship.




3. Interpretation

If p-value < 0.05, reject  → Gender and Loan Status are dependent.

Otherwise, fail to reject  → No significant relationship.





---

Approach for Multiple Categorical Variables

If you have more than two categorical variables, consider the following approaches:

1. Pairwise Chi-Square Tests

Conduct Chi-Square tests between different categorical pairs.

Example: Gender vs Loan_Status, Married vs Loan_Status, Property_Area vs Loan_Status.



2. Cramer’s V (Effect Size for Categorical Variables)

Helps measure strength of association.

Formula: 

If  is close to 1, strong association; close to 0, weak association.



3. Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)

Used when more than two categorical variables are involved.

Works similarly to PCA for categorical data.



4. Chi-Square Post-Hoc Tests

If more than two categories, use Bonferroni correction to control Type I error.

Example: If Property_Area has Urban, Rural, Semiurban, run multiple Chi-Square tests with adjusted alpha.





---

Next Steps

Would you like me to:

Visualize the contingency table using heatmaps?

Extend this analysis with a post-hoc test for multi-category variables?

Perform Cramer’s V calculations for effect size?


Let me know what you prefer!

One-Sample T-Test for Mean Comparison

A one-sample T-test checks whether the mean of a sample is significantly different from a known or assumed population mean.


---

Hypothesis Statement

Null Hypothesis (): The mean loan amount in the dataset is not significantly different from an assumed population mean.

Alternative Hypothesis (): The mean loan amount is significantly different from the assumed population mean.



---

Python Code for One-Sample T-Test

Let’s assume that the average loan amount in the population is 150 (arbitrary value for demonstration). We’ll test whether our sample mean significantly differs from this.

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"  # Adjust if needed
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Drop missing values in LoanAmount column
loan_df = loan_df.dropna(subset=['LoanAmount'])

# Define the assumed population mean (change this based on real-world expectations)
pop_mean = 150  

# Perform One-Sample T-Test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(loan_df['LoanAmount'], pop_mean)

# Print results
print(f"Sample Mean Loan Amount: {loan_df['LoanAmount'].mean():.2f}")
print(f"Test Statistic (t-value): {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("\nReject the null hypothesis: The sample mean loan amount is significantly different from 150.")
else:
    print("\nFail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference between the sample mean and 150.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Reads the dataset and removes missing values from LoanAmount.

Defines 150 as the assumed population mean loan amount.



2. Hypothesis Testing

Uses scipy.stats.ttest_1samp() to compare the sample mean to the population mean.

Computes:

t-statistic: Measures the difference in means adjusted for sample variability.

p-value: Probability of obtaining the observed sample mean if  is true.




3. Interpretation

If p-value < 0.05, reject  → The sample mean loan amount is significantly different from 150.

Otherwise, fail to reject  → No significant difference.





---

Handling Multiple Variables

If you need to perform multiple T-tests:

Loop through different numerical columns (e.g., ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome).

Use Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons.



---

Next Steps

Would you like to:

Visualize loan amount distribution with histograms?

Test another variable like ApplicantIncome?

Compare two groups (e.g., loan amount by gender) using a two-sample T-test?


Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Two-Sample T-Test: Comparing Two Means

A two-sample (independent) T-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups.


---

Hypothesis Statement

Null Hypothesis (): The mean loan amount for males and females is not significantly different.

Alternative Hypothesis (): The mean loan amount for males and females is significantly different.



---

Python Code for Two-Sample T-Test

We will compare the mean LoanAmount between male and female applicants.

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"  # Adjust if needed
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Drop missing values in Gender and LoanAmount columns
loan_df = loan_df.dropna(subset=['Gender', 'LoanAmount'])

# Filter data into two groups
male_loans = loan_df[loan_df['Gender'] == 'Male']['LoanAmount']
female_loans = loan_df[loan_df['Gender'] == 'Female']['LoanAmount']

# Perform Two-Sample (Independent) T-Test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(male_loans, female_loans, equal_var=False)  # Welch's T-test (assumes unequal variance)

# Print results
print(f"Mean Loan Amount (Male): {male_loans.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Mean Loan Amount (Female): {female_loans.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Test Statistic (t-value): {t_stat:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("\nReject the null hypothesis: The mean loan amount is significantly different between males and females.")
else:
    print("\nFail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference in mean loan amount between males and females.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Reads the dataset and removes missing values from Gender and LoanAmount.

Splits the dataset into two independent groups: Males and Females.



2. Hypothesis Testing

Uses scipy.stats.ttest_ind() for an independent T-test:

Compares mean LoanAmount between Males and Females.

Assumes unequal variance (equal_var=False uses Welch’s T-test, which is more reliable when variance differs).




3. Interpretation

If p-value < 0.05, reject  → Significant difference in loan amount between males and females.

Otherwise, fail to reject  → No significant difference.





---

Handling More Groups

If you have more than two groups (e.g., Property_Area with Urban, Rural, Semiurban), use:

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Compares means across multiple groups.

Post-hoc Tests (Tukey’s Test): Identifies specific group differences.



---

Next Steps

Would you like to:

Visualize loan amount distributions for males and females?

Compare another numeric variable (e.g., ApplicantIncome)?

Perform ANOVA for multi-group comparisons?


Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

ANOVA (F-Test) for Comparing Multiple Groups

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests whether the means of three or more independent groups are significantly different.


---

Hypothesis Statement

Null Hypothesis (): The mean loan amount is not significantly different across different property areas.

Alternative Hypothesis (): The mean loan amount is significantly different across at least one property area.



---

Python Code for One-Way ANOVA (F-Test)

We will compare LoanAmount across three property areas (Urban, Rural, Semiurban).

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"  # Adjust if needed
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Drop missing values in Property_Area and LoanAmount columns
loan_df = loan_df.dropna(subset=['Property_Area', 'LoanAmount'])

# Group data by Property_Area
urban_loans = loan_df[loan_df['Property_Area'] == 'Urban']['LoanAmount']
rural_loans = loan_df[loan_df['Property_Area'] == 'Rural']['LoanAmount']
semiurban_loans = loan_df[loan_df['Property_Area'] == 'Semiurban']['LoanAmount']

# Perform One-Way ANOVA (F-Test)
f_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(urban_loans, rural_loans, semiurban_loans)

# Print results
print(f"Mean Loan Amount (Urban): {urban_loans.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Mean Loan Amount (Rural): {rural_loans.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Mean Loan Amount (Semiurban): {semiurban_loans.mean():.2f}")
print(f"\nF-Statistic: {f_stat:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Interpretation
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("\nReject the null hypothesis: There is a significant difference in loan amounts across property areas.")
else:
    print("\nFail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference in loan amounts across property areas.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Reads the dataset and removes missing values in Property_Area and LoanAmount.

Creates three independent groups based on Property_Area.



2. ANOVA Test Execution

Uses scipy.stats.f_oneway() to compute:

F-statistic: Ratio of variance between groups to variance within groups.

P-value: Probability of observing data if  is true.




3. Interpretation

If p-value < 0.05, reject  → At least one property area has a significantly different loan amount.

Otherwise, fail to reject  → No significant difference.





---

Handling More than Three Groups

If you need to compare more than three groups, consider:

Tukey’s HSD Test: Identifies which specific groups differ.

Levene’s Test: Checks if variances are equal before applying ANOVA.



---

Next Steps

Would you like to:

Perform a post-hoc Tukey’s test for detailed pairwise comparisons?

Visualize results with boxplots?

Apply ANOVA on another numeric variable like ApplicantIncome?


Let me know how you'd like to proceed!




The test being performed in your screenshot is a Two-Sample T-Test (Independent T-Test), which is the 4th test among the five you asked about.


---

Which Test is This?

This test compares the mean ApplicantIncome between Graduates and Non-Graduates to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two groups.

Hypothesis Statement:

Null Hypothesis (): There is no significant difference in the mean income of graduates and non-graduates.

Alternative Hypothesis (): The mean income of graduates and non-graduates is significantly different.


Key Features of This Test:

Two groups (Graduate vs. Non-Graduate)

Numeric variable (ApplicantIncome)

Comparing means → Independent (Unpaired) T-Test



---

How This Maps to the Tests You Asked:

This test falls under Test 4 (Two-Sample T-Test) because it compares two means (Graduate vs. Non-Graduate ApplicantIncome).


---

Interpretation of Output

Mean Income of Graduates: 5857.43

Mean Income of Non-Graduates: 3777.28

T-statistic: 5.725 (Measures difference in means relative to variance)

P-value: 1.63e-08 (0.0000000163)
→ Since the p-value is much smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, meaning graduates have significantly higher income than non-graduates.



---

Would you like to extend this analysis further?
For example:

Visualizing Income Distributions with Boxplots?

Checking if income variance is equal before applying the test?

Performing a One-Way ANOVA if more education levels exist?


Let me know how you'd like to proceed!


Covariance and Correlation Analysis Using Loan Dataset

We'll explore Covariance and Correlation in your dataset by selecting meaningful numerical attributes for analysis.


---

1. Covariance: Measuring the Direction of Relationship

Covariance measures how two variables move together. It only tells us the direction (positive, negative, or none), but not the strength.

Example Hypothesis

Does ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount increase together?

If positive → Higher income leads to larger loan amounts.

If negative → Higher income leads to smaller loans (unlikely in this case).

If near zero → No relationship.



Python Code for Covariance

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Select numeric columns
loan_df = loan_df[['ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount']].dropna()

# Compute Covariance Matrix
cov_matrix = loan_df.cov()

# Display Covariance Matrix
import ace_tools as tools
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Covariance Matrix", dataframe=cov_matrix)

# Interpretation
print("\nCovariance Interpretation:")
if cov_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount'] > 0:
    print("Applicant Income and Loan Amount have a positive covariance → Higher income applicants tend to take higher loan amounts.")
elif cov_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount'] < 0:
    print("Applicant Income and Loan Amount have a negative covariance → Higher income applicants tend to take lower loan amounts.")
else:
    print("No relationship between Applicant Income and Loan Amount.")


---

2. Correlation: Strength & Direction of Relationship

Correlation normalizes covariance, giving a value between -1 to 1.

1 → Strong Positive Correlation (Increase together)

-1 → Strong Negative Correlation (One increases, the other decreases)

0 → No correlation


Example Hypothesis

Does ApplicantIncome strongly correlate with LoanAmount?

Do CoapplicantIncome and LoanAmount have a weak relationship?


Python Code for Correlation

# Compute Correlation Matrix
corr_matrix = loan_df.corr()

# Display Correlation Matrix
tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Correlation Matrix", dataframe=corr_matrix)

# Interpretation
print("\nCorrelation Interpretation:")
if corr_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount'] > 0.7:
    print("Strong positive correlation → Higher incomes strongly influence higher loan amounts.")
elif 0.3 < corr_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount'] <= 0.7:
    print("Moderate correlation → Higher incomes somewhat influence loan amounts.")
elif -0.3 < corr_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount'] <= 0.3:
    print("Weak or no correlation → Loan amount is independent of applicant income.")
else:
    print("Negative correlation → Unlikely in this scenario.")

# Optional: Visualization (scatter plot)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(loan_df['ApplicantIncome'], loan_df['LoanAmount'], alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("Applicant Income")
plt.ylabel("Loan Amount")
plt.title("Applicant Income vs Loan Amount (Correlation)")
plt.show()


---

Next Steps

Would you like to:

Run these tests on other numeric attributes (e.g., Loan Term, Credit History)?

Visualize correlation using a heatmap for better insights?


Let me know how you want to explore further!




Sure! Below is the corrected Python code for calculating the Covariance Matrix without using ace_tools.


---

Covariance Analysis: Measuring Direction of Relationship

Covariance tells us if two variables move together (positive), opposite (negative), or have no relation.

Example Hypothesis

Does ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount increase together?

If positive → Higher income leads to larger loan amounts.

If negative → Higher income leads to smaller loans.

If near zero → No relationship.




---

Python Code for Covariance

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"
loan_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Select relevant numeric columns and drop NaN values
loan_df = loan_df[['ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount']].dropna()

# Compute Covariance Matrix
cov_matrix = loan_df.cov()

# Display Covariance Matrix
print("Covariance Matrix:\n", cov_matrix)

# Interpretation
print("\nCovariance Interpretation:")
cov_value = cov_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount']

if cov_value > 0:
    print("Applicant Income and Loan Amount have a **positive covariance** → Higher income applicants tend to take higher loan amounts.")
elif cov_value < 0:
    print("Applicant Income and Loan Amount have a **negative covariance** → Higher income applicants tend to take lower loan amounts.")
else:
    print("No relationship between Applicant Income and Loan Amount.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Loads the dataset.

Selects ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, and LoanAmount.

Drops any missing values.



2. Computing Covariance

loan_df.cov() calculates the covariance matrix.



3. Interpretation

If covariance is positive, both values increase together.

If negative, one increases while the other decreases.

If near zero, they are not related.





---

Next Steps

Would you like:

A visualization of these relationships (scatter plots)?

A correlation matrix to check strength of relationships?

Covariance analysis for other attributes?


Let me know how you'd like to proceed!


Great! Below is the complete Python code for computing Covariance and Correlation, along with heatmaps for visualization.

Covariance & Correlation Analysis with Heatmaps

We will:

1. Compute the Covariance Matrix – Shows how two variables move together.


2. Compute the Correlation Matrix – Normalized version of covariance, giving values between -1 and 1.


3. Visualize both using heatmaps.

Python Code for Covariance & Correlation with Heatmaps

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
file_path = "/mnt/data/file-7R8twDz95L3AoZccAWNpS1"

elif cov_value < 0:
    print("Applicant Income and Loan Amount have a **negative covariance** → Higher income applicants tend to take lower loan amounts.")
else:
    print("No relationship between Applicant Income and Loan Amount.")

# Correlation Interpretation
corr_value = corr_matrix.loc['ApplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount']
if corr_value > 0.7:
    print("Strong positive correlation → Higher incomes strongly influence higher loan amounts.")
elif 0.3 < corr_value <= 0.7:
    print("Moderate correlation → Higher incomes somewhat influence loan amounts.")
elif -0.3 < corr_value <= 0.3:
    print("Weak or no correlation → Loan amount is independent of applicant income.")
else:
    print("Negative correlation → Unlikely in this scenario.")


---

Explanation

1. Data Preparation

Selects ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, and LoanAmount.

Drops missing values.



2. Covariance & Correlation Computation

Covariance (.cov()) → Measures direction of relationship.

Correlation (.corr()) → Standardized measure of strength (between -1 and 1).



3. Heatmap Visualizations

Uses Seaborn heatmaps to visualize covariance and correlation.



4. Interpretation

If covariance > 0, both variables increase together.

If correlation > 0.7, strong relationship.

If correlation between -0.3 and 0.3, weak or no relationship.

Here is a Python script to mimic the hypothesis testing experiment for a biased coin:

import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats

# Experiment setup
n_flips = 100  # Number of flips
p_fair = 0.5  # Probability of heads for a fair coin

# Simulate coin flips (1 represents heads, 0 represents tails)
np.random.seed(42)  # Set seed for reproducibility
flips = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_flips, p=[1 - p_fair, p_fair])

# Count number of heads
observed_heads = np.sum(flips)
expected_heads = n_flips * p_fair  # Expected number of heads under H0
std_dev = np.sqrt(n_flips * p_fair * (1 - p_fair))  # Standard deviation

# Compute test statistic (Z-score)
z_score = (observed_heads - expected_heads) / std_dev

# Compute p-value (two-tailed test)
p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(z_score)))

# Significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Display results
print(f"Observed heads: {observed_heads}")
print(f"Expected heads: {expected_heads}")
print(f"Z-score: {z_score:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Hypothesis testing decision
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The coin is likely biased.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No strong evidence that the coin is biased.")

Explanation:

1. Simulates flipping a fair coin 100 times.


2. Counts the number of heads observed.


3. Computes the Z-score to measure how extreme the result is.


4. Calculates the p-value to determine if the result is statistically significant.


5. Compares the p-value to the significance level (α = 0.05).


6. If the p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude the coin may be biased.



Run this script, and it will mimic the hypothesis testing example from the slide. Let me know if you need modifications!
