In my role, I developed a solution that transformed our manual process into a robust, automated system, benefiting the entire team by providing a single-point solution for all process-related assessments. This shift from manual to automated processes has streamlined our operations, making it easier for team members to complete their tasks efficiently and consistently.

Aside from building the solution from the ground up, I have also worked closely with team members, presenting demos and assisting them with onboarding. So far, we have successfully onboarded one collective team and conducted two PKT assessments in the production environment. Additionally, we are currently working on UAT testing for two more teams, with onboarding testing underway for one more. Another team is in the pipeline, and once the first three are fully onboarded, we will begin working with them as well.

Beyond building the solution, I also engaged with team members, conducting product demos and assisting with onboarding. To date, we have successfully onboarded a full team and completed two assessments in the live environment. Currently, we are working on UAT testing for two more teams, with onboarding testing for another team in progress. Additionally, one more team is lined up, and we will start with them once the ongoing tasks are completed.
