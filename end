Here’s a straightforward and professional version based on your input:

In my role, I developed a solution that transformed our manual process into a robust, automated system, benefiting the entire team by providing a single-point solution for all process-related assessments. This shift from manual to automated processes has streamlined our operations, making it easier for team members to complete their tasks efficiently and consistently.

Aside from building the solution from the ground up, I have also worked closely with team members, presenting demos and assisting them with onboarding. So far, we have successfully onboarded one collective team and conducted two PKT assessments in the production environment. Additionally, we are currently working on UAT testing for two more teams, with onboarding testing underway for one more. Another team is in the pipeline, and once the first three are fully onboarded, we will begin working with them as well.

This captures what you've accomplished and stays true to the simple, professional tone you requested. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!

I took the initiative to design and implement a solution that transformed the previous manual processes into an automated system, ensuring a more efficient and reliable way of handling tasks. This new system provides a single-point solution for all scenarios, making it accessible and beneficial for all users.

Beyond building the solution, I also engaged with team members, conducting product demos and assisting with onboarding. To date, we have successfully onboarded a full team and completed two assessments in the live environment. Currently, we are working on UAT testing for two more teams, with onboarding testing for another team in progress. Additionally, one more team is lined up, and we will start with them once the ongoing tasks are completed.

This keeps the tone simple and professional, matching your style. Let me know if this works!


Here’s the first paragraph rewritten to align more closely with the PKT tool:


---

I led the development of a solution within the PKT tool, transforming the manual process of conducting knowledge assessments into a streamlined, automated system. This new approach allows for efficient tracking and management of all assessments in one place, ensuring consistency and accuracy. The automated process benefits all users by providing a single-point solution for conducting Process Knowledge Tests, making the overall workflow more robust and reducing the risk of errors.

This version focuses on the PKT tool and how your work directly impacted its functionality. Let me know if this fits better!



In the Money Movement project, I played an integral role in simplifying and standardizing the reconciliation process across thirty Operations teams. By eliminating variations in how teams performed reconciliation tasks, we were able to streamline the entire process. One of the key contributions was the implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate these reconciliations, ensuring a consistent and efficient approach. This included developing a daily reconciliation report that teams could easily use to identify and address any discrepancies in a timely and standardized manner.

The impact of this project has been substantial. It has not only enhanced the employee experience by allowing teams to quickly identify and resolve reconciliation errors, but it has also significantly reduced the need for manual tracking of transactions and funded amounts. This automation has reduced risks, particularly the risk of duplicate payments, by providing real-time, accurate data to employees. With the improved control environment, potential duplicate payments are flagged immediately, allowing for prompt review.

I am proud to be a part of this important initiative, which was recognized for its impact and was published on the Wells Fargo homepage.

AWB

I am currently involved in the Analytics Workbench (AWB) project, a cloud-based system designed to support various analytics-related projects.

Role:

My responsibilities include understanding AWB's functionality, securing access for my team, and facilitating a seamless transition from local/VDIs to the AWB cloud platform. I am currently working with the WIM team to set up AWB for their use. Additionally, I created a proof of concept (POC) to reduce the time required to fetch data from the data lake and am now collaborating with Noki Luat to implement this solution for their specific use case.

Impact:

This transition is expected to have a significant impact by providing increased storage options and access to a wider array of tools, including the Enterprise Data Lake, ultimately enhancing our analytics capabilities within AWB.
