In my role, I developed a solution that transformed our manual process into a robust, automated system, benefiting the entire team by providing a single-point solution for all process-related assessments. This shift from manual to automated processes has streamlined our operations, making it easier for team members to complete their tasks efficiently and consistently.

Aside from building the solution from the ground up, I have also worked closely with team members, presenting demos and assisting them with onboarding. So far, we have successfully onboarded one collective team and conducted two PKT assessments in the production environment. Additionally, we are currently working on UAT testing for two more teams, with onboarding testing underway for one more. Another team is in the pipeline, and once the first three are fully onboarded, we will begin working with them as well.

I took the initiative to design and implement a solution that transformed the previous manual processes into an automated system, ensuring a more efficient and reliable way of handling tasks. This new system provides a single-point solution for all scenarios, making it accessible and beneficial for all users.

Beyond building the solution, I also engaged with team members, conducting product demos and assisting with onboarding. To date, we have successfully onboarded a full team and completed two assessments in the live environment. Currently, we are working on UAT testing for two more teams, with onboarding testing for another team in progress. Additionally, one more team is lined up, and we will start with them once the ongoing tasks are completed.

Here’s the first paragraph rewritten to align more closely with the PKT tool:


---

I led the development of a solution within the PKT tool, transforming the manual process of conducting knowledge assessments into a streamlined, automated system. This new approach allows for efficient tracking and management of all assessments in one place, ensuring consistency and accuracy. The automated process benefits all users by providing a single-point solution for conducting Process Knowledge Tests, making the overall workflow more robust and reducing the risk of errors.

In the Money Movement project, I played an integral role in simplifying and standardizing the reconciliation process across thirty Operations teams. By eliminating variations in how teams performed reconciliation tasks, we were able to streamline the entire process. One of the key contributions was the implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate these reconciliations, ensuring a consistent and efficient approach. This included developing a daily reconciliation report that teams could easily use to identify and address any discrepancies in a timely and standardized manner.

The impact of this project has been substantial. It has not only enhanced the employee experience by allowing teams to quickly identify and resolve reconciliation errors, but it has also significantly reduced the need for manual tracking of transactions and funded amounts. This automation has reduced risks, particularly the risk of duplicate payments, by providing real-time, accurate data to employees. With the improved control environment, potential duplicate payments are flagged immediately, allowing for prompt review.

I am proud to be a part of this important initiative, which was recognized for its impact and was published on the Wells Fargo homepage.

AWB

I am currently involved in the Analytics Workbench (AWB) project, a cloud-based system designed to support various analytics-related projects.

Role:

My responsibilities include understanding AWB's functionality, securing access for my team, and facilitating a seamless transition from local/VDIs to the AWB cloud platform. I am currently working with the WIM team to set up AWB for their use. Additionally, I created a proof of concept (POC) to reduce the time required to fetch data from the data lake and am now collaborating with Noki Luat to implement this solution for their specific use case.

Impact:

This transition is expected to have a significant impact by providing increased storage options and access to a wider array of tools, including the Enterprise Data Lake, ultimately enhancing our analytics capabilities within AWB.

Project Description:

The CBDS project focuses on developing an automation and OCR solution to enhance operational efficiency by automating manual tasks related to processing balance sheets. Specifically, this involves automating the process of referring to multiple Excel balance sheets, using that information to match entries in the Optmist system, converting Excel sheets to PDFs, and then uploading the balance sheets into the Optmist platform. These tasks have historically been time-consuming and prone to human error, creating bottlenecks in the workflow.

Impact:

By introducing an OCR and automation solution, we are significantly reducing the manual effort required to handle balance sheet processing. This automation will streamline the entire workflow, allowing data to be accurately captured from Excel sheets and processed automatically. The result is improved accuracy and a reduction in the time needed to complete these tasks, which helps prevent errors and increases overall productivity. Through my role, I am contributing to a solution that not only improves operational efficiency but also helps to minimize risk and ensure consistent data handling for the team.

The primary focus will be on advancing the GSS Dashboards and utilizing analytics to provide more meaningful insights for business users. Additionally, scaling the PKT tool will be a top priority. I aim to further refine my skillset in Tableau, SQL, analytics, Python, automation, and Alteryx. Looking ahead, I plan to leverage my expertise in Python and analytics to take on more projects in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), OCR, and forecasting.

Employee Summary:

Throughout the year, I have remained dedicated and efficient in completing all tasks across key projects, including PKT, Money Movement, GSS, GitHub, and AWB.

In the PKT Tool project, I led the transformation of a manual process into an automated solution that has significantly improved efficiency for over 4,000 team members. I have successfully onboarded one team and conducted two PKTs in production, with UAT testing in progress for more teams.

As part of the Money Movement Project, I contributed to one of the operations teams by developing an automated solution to streamline daily reconciliation tasks, which has reduced manual efforts and improved accuracy. This project was also featured on the Wells Fargo homepage.

Under the GSS 2.0 initiative, we expanded Tableau dashboard solutions to new organizations, generated MM EOD reports, and handled ad hoc requests using Python and Windows Task Scheduler. Additionally, I contributed to developing a text analytics POC for extracting insights from comment data and worked on automating the Process Knowledge Tool with Power Apps, further enhancing process efficiency.

Looking forward, I aim to continue refining my expertise in Tableau, SQL, Python, analytics, deep learning, and automation, and to leverage these skills to bring more meaningful insights and improvements to upcoming projects.

Report Migration Project:

In this project, I am responsible for migrating old reports from SQL Server Report Builder, which is being retired, to a more modern platform like Power BI and Alteryx. This migration involves analyzing existing reports, redesigning them in the new platform, and ensuring that all data and functionality are preserved. By transitioning to Power BI and Alteryx, we are not only enhancing the visualizations but also improving the overall reporting efficiency and scalability. My role includes managing the migration process, optimizing the new reports, and providing a more robust and user-friendly reporting solution for the team.
