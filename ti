Hereâ€™s a Python script to calculate the starting date of the month 3 months ago and the ending date of the current month:

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

def get_last_three_months_dates():
    # Current date
    today = datetime.today()
    
    # Get starting date of 3 months ago
    start_date = (today.replace(day=1) - relativedelta(months=2)).replace(day=1)
    
    # Get ending date of the current month
    end_date = (today + relativedelta(months=1)).replace(day=1) - timedelta(days=1)
    
    return start_date, end_date

# Example usage
start_date, end_date = get_last_three_months_dates()
print("Start Date:", start_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
print("End Date:", end_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))

Explanation:

1. today.replace(day=1) ensures we start from the first day of the current month.


2. relativedelta(months=2) shifts back by two months to get to the start of the month 3 months ago.


3. + relativedelta(months=1) and timedelta(days=1) calculate the last day of the current month.


4. .strftime() is used for a formatted date string.



Example Output:

If today is December 9, 2024:

Start Date: 2024-09-01
End Date: 2024-11-30
