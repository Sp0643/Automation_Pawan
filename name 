Thanks for the detailed explanation! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what you're asking for, and then I’ll provide the full Python code to do this:

Step-by-step Plan

1. Load three Excel files:

File 1: DataFrame A (has User Name)

File 2: DataFrame B (also has User Name)

File 3: Roster DataFrame (has User Name, Manager, Team)



2. Append A and B vertically into one combined DataFrame.


3. Clean the User Name field in both the combined DataFrame and Roster:

Remove whitespaces

Remove punctuation

Convert to lowercase

Sort characters in alphabetical order



4. Do a lookup (left join) from combined data to Roster using the cleaned name.


5. Select only the relevant final columns:

Original User Name

Manager

Team

And any other specific columns you want (please specify if needed)





---

Python Code

import pandas as pd
import string

# Load the Excel files
df1 = pd.read_excel("file1.xlsx")
df2 = pd.read_excel("file2.xlsx")
roster_df = pd.read_excel("roster.xlsx")

# Combine df1 and df2 vertically
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

# Function to normalize user names
def normalize_name(name):
    if pd.isna(name):
        return ''
    name = ''.join(e for e in str(name) if e.isalnum()).lower()
    return ''.join(sorted(name))

# Add normalized name column to both datasets
combined_df['NormalizedName'] = combined_df['User Name'].apply(normalize_name)
roster_df['NormalizedName'] = roster_df['User Name'].apply(normalize_name)

# Merge on NormalizedName
final_df = pd.merge(combined_df, roster_df[['NormalizedName', 'Manager', 'Team']], on='NormalizedName', how='left')

# Choose relevant final output columns
output_df = final_df[['User Name', 'Manager', 'Team'] + [col for col in combined_df.columns if col != 'NormalizedName' and col != 'User Name']]

# Save final output
output_df.to_excel("final_output.xlsx", index=False)


---

Expected Output

You will get a single Excel file final_output.xlsx with:

The original user name

Their matched Manager

Their matched Team

And other relevant data from your original files A and B

If you want me to customize the final columns or handle any other special cleaning rules, feel free to share. Also, let me know if you're working with .csv files or different sheet names.



Perfect — you're looking to perform a lookup (similar to Excel’s VLOOKUP) where for each user in df1, you find their Manager from df2 based on User Name.


---

Scenario

df1 contains a User Name column (the main dataset)

df2 contains User Name, Manager, and maybe Team

The issue: names might be written differently, so we'll normalize before matching:

Lowercase

Remove whitespace

Remove punctuation

Sort letters alphabetically




---

Python Code (with lookup using normalization)

import pandas as pd
import string

# Load your data
df1 = pd.read_excel("file1.xlsx")
df2 = pd.read_excel("file2.xlsx")  # This acts like your "roster"

# Function to normalize names
def normalize_name(name):
    if pd.isna(name):
        return ''
    # Remove punctuation and whitespace, convert to lowercase, then sort
    cleaned = ''.join(char for char in str(name) if char.isalnum()).lower()
    return ''.join(sorted(cleaned))

# Apply normalization to both datasets
df1['NormalizedName'] = df1['User Name'].apply(normalize_name)
df2['NormalizedName'] = df2['User Name'].apply(normalize_name)

# Create a lookup dictionary from df2
manager_lookup = df2.set_index('NormalizedName')['Manager'].to_dict()
team_lookup = df2.set_index('NormalizedName')['Team'].to_dict() if 'Team' in df2.columns else {}

# Map Manager and Team to df1 using normalized names
df1['Manager'] = df1['NormalizedName'].map(manager_lookup)
df1['Team'] = df1['NormalizedName'].map(team_lookup)

# Drop the helper column if not needed
df1.drop(columns=['NormalizedName'], inplace=True)

# Save or display final result
df1.to_excel("output_with_manager_lookup.xlsx", index=False)


---

What You Get

df1 will now have two new columns: Manager and Team (if available in df2)

Lookup is fuzzy — so even slightly mismatched names get resolved if characters are same
