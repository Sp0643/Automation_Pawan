Yes, I understand your requirement clearly now:

You want to create a calculated field SPLIT in Tableau that classifies each time chunk as one of these:

Productive (Celonis)

Non-Productive (Celonis)

Idle (Celonis)

Others (Celonis)

Productive (Cap Plan)

Non-Productive (Cap Plan)


So you can stack bars based on the source (Celonis vs Cap Plan) and activity type.

✅ Step-by-Step Logic for SPLIT Field

We’ll create a SPLIT field like this:

IF [Productivity CP] > 0 THEN "Productive (Cap Plan)"
ELSEIF [Non-Productivity CP] > 0 THEN "Non-Productive (Cap Plan)"
ELSEIF [Productive] > 0 THEN "Productive (Celonis)"
ELSEIF [Non-Productive] > 0 THEN "Non-Productive (Celonis)"
ELSEIF [Idle] > 0 THEN "Idle (Celonis)"
ELSEIF [Others] > 0 THEN "Others (Celonis)"
END


---

✅ How to Use in the Chart

1. Create the SPLIT field with the formula above.


2. Create a Measure Names/Measure Values view for these:

Productivity CP

Non-Productivity CP

Productive

Non-Productive

Idle

Others



3. Drag SPLIT to Color to distinguish activity type + source.


4. Drag User ID or "System" to Columns (or Rows).


5. Drag all related measures to Measure Values and plot as stacked bar.

✅ Optional (More Flexible Logic)

If you're looping row-by-row instead of checking presence, use this instead:

IF [SPLIT Category] = "Productive_CP" THEN "Productive (Cap Plan)"
ELSEIF [SPLIT Category] = "Non-Productive_CP" THEN "Non-Productive (Cap Plan)"
ELSEIF [SPLIT Category] = "Productive" THEN "Productive (Celonis)"
ELSEIF [SPLIT Category] = "Non-Productive" THEN "Non-Productive (Celonis)"
ELSEIF [SPLIT Category] = "Idle" THEN "Idle (Celonis)"
ELSEIF [SPLIT Category] = "Others" THEN "Others (Celonis)"
END

Where SPLIT Category is a pre-created column with values like "Productive_CP", "Idle", etc.

Would you like a mock data reshaping structure that you can use for building it with Tableau’s "pivot" or union method?
