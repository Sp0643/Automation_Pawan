Absolutely! Let's start from the very basics, so you understand what a function is, how it works, and how to build up gradually to a more complex one.

ðŸ”¹ What is a Python Function?

A function is like a recipe. You give it some ingredients (called inputs or arguments), and it gives you a result (called output or return value).


---

âœ… Step 1: Your First Function (Simple Addition)

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

Explanation:

def means you're defining a function.

add_numbers is the name of the function.

a, b are inputs.

a + b adds the numbers.

return result gives the output.


Try it:

print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Output: 5


---

âœ… Step 2: Add a Message (More Friendly Output)

def greet_user(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greet_user("Sohan")  # Output: Hello, Sohan!


---

âœ… Step 3: A Function with Decision Making (if-else)

def check_even_or_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

print(check_even_or_odd(4))  # Output: Even
print(check_even_or_odd(7))  # Output: Odd


---

âœ… Step 4: A Slightly Complex One â€“ Average of List

def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    average = total / count
    return average

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(calculate_average(my_list))  # Output: 25.0


---

âœ… Step 5: Final: Build a Custom Function Together

Letâ€™s say you want to:

Take a list of numbers.

Remove any negative numbers.

Square the remaining numbers.

Return the result.


def process_numbers(numbers):
    clean_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num >= 0:
            clean_numbers.append(num ** 2)
    return clean_numbers

sample = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
print(process_numbers(sample))  # Output: [1, 9, 25]

Would you like to now:

1. Try writing a function yourself and Iâ€™ll guide you?


2. Move to more complex logic like working with files, charts, or APIs?


3. Build something fun like a number guessing game or calculator?
