Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a Python script using pandas to help you create a scaffold table of all User ID Ã— Date combinations by:

1. Reading User IDs from one Excel sheet.


2. Reading Dates from another Excel sheet.


3. Generating a cross join to get the full scaffold.

âœ… Python Code

import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Read user list and date list from Excel
user_df = pd.read_excel("your_file.xlsx", sheet_name="Users")     # contains column 'User ID'
date_df = pd.read_excel("your_file.xlsx", sheet_name="Dates")     # contains column 'Date'

# Step 2: Create cross join using temporary key
user_df['key'] = 1
date_df['key'] = 1

scaffold_df = pd.merge(user_df, date_df, on='key').drop('key', axis=1)

# Optional: Sort for readability
scaffold_df = scaffold_df.sort_values(by=['User ID', 'Date'])

# Step 3: Save the scaffold to Excel
scaffold_df.to_excel("user_date_scaffold.xlsx", index=False)

print("âœ… Scaffold created successfully with", len(scaffold_df), "rows.")

ðŸ“‚ Output File

This will generate a file called user_date_scaffold.xlsx like this:

User ID	Date

A0001	2025-04-01
A0001	2025-04-02
A0001	2025-04-03
A0002	2025-04-01
...	...

Let me know if:

Your column names are different

You want to merge this with actual data too in the same script

You want to generate the date range dynamically without Excel


I'm happy to adjust it!
