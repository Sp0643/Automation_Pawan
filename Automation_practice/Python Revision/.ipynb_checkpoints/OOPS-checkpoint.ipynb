    "\n",
    "Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "* It is a reusable piece of code that can be called from different parts of the program.\n",
    "* Functions are not associated with any specific object or class; they are standalone entities.\n",
    "* In most programming languages, functions are defined outside of classes and can be called directly by their name.\n",
    "* Examples of functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "   return a + b\n",

    "def greet(name):\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A method is also a block of code that performs a specific task, but it is associated with an object or a class.\n",
    "* It is like a function that operates on an object and can access the data within that object.\n",
    "* Methods are called on objects and are specific to the type of object (class) they belong to.\n",
    "* In most object-oriented programming languages, methods are defined within classes.\n",
    "* Examples of methods in Python:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above example, add_numbers and greet are functions, while start_engine is a method belonging to the Car class.\n",

    "To summarize, the main difference between a function and a method is their association with objects or classes. Functions are standalone blocks of code, while methods are functions that are tied to specific objects or classes and operate on the data associated with them.\n",
