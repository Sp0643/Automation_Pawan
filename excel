Certainly! Hereâ€™s how you can implement a solution in Python to dynamically find the row containing the headers and fetch the data beneath it. This can be done using pandas:

Steps:

1. Read the Excel file without specifying headers, so you get all rows as raw data.


2. Search for the row containing the headers by checking for the known header elements.


3. Once the header row is identified, re-read the Excel file, specifying that row as the header, and fetch the data beneath it.



Code Example:

import pandas as pd

def find_header_and_extract_data(file_path, known_headers):
    # Read the Excel file without headers
    df = pd.read_excel(file_path, header=None)

    # Find the row index containing all the known headers
    header_row = None
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        if all(header in row.values for header in known_headers):
            header_row = i
            break

    if header_row is not None:
        # Read the Excel file again, specifying the identified header row
        data = pd.read_excel(file_path, header=header_row)
        return data
    else:
        print("Header not found.")
        return None

# Example usage:
file_path = "your_excel_file.xlsx"
known_headers = ["Column1", "Column2", "Column3"]  # Replace with your actual header names

data = find_header_and_extract_data(file_path, known_headers)
if data is not None:
    print("Extracted Data:")
    print(data)

Explanation:

1. First Pass: The header=None ensures the file is read as-is, without assuming any row as the header.


2. Header Search: The script iterates through the rows to check if all known headers are present in a given row.


3. Second Pass: Once the correct row is identified, the Excel file is read again, this time using that row as the header.


4. Output: The data variable will contain the filtered dataset.



Key Benefits:

Dynamic Header Detection: The row containing the headers can vary, and this code will adjust accordingly.

Easy Extension: You can add additional conditions to refine header detection logic.


Output Example:

If your Excel file looks like this:

The output will be:

Extracted Data:
   Column1  Column2  Column3
0        1        2        3
1        4        5        6

Would you like me to help you test this with a sample Excel file?
