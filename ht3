Review of the Notes â€” Accuracy and Explanation

The provided notes contain key points about major statistical tests. Let's analyze each point for accuracy and clarity:


---

1. Z-Test

âœ… Correct Information:

Used when sample size â‰¥ 30.

Requires population standard deviation (Ïƒ) to be known.

Suitable for testing population means or proportions in large sample sizes.


âœ… Example Use Case:

Testing if the average salary in a city differs from the national average when Ïƒ is known.



---

2. T-Test

âœ… Correct Information (with clarification):

Used when sample size < 30 or â‰¥ 30, but the population standard deviation (Ïƒ) is NOT known.

Suitable for comparing means of one or two groups.


ðŸ’¡ Additional Clarification:

One-Sample T-Test â†’ Tests if the sample mean differs from a known value.

Two-Sample T-Test â†’ Compares means between two groups.

Paired T-Test â†’ Compares means in matched or dependent samples.


âœ… Example Use Case:

Testing if a new teaching method improves test scores using data from a small class.



---

3. F-Test

âœ… Correct Information:

Used to compare two variances.

Often conducted before a two-sample T-test to check if variances are equal.


ðŸ’¡ Additional Insight:

F-Test is rarely used alone; it's primarily a supporting test for ANOVA and regression analysis.


âœ… Example Use Case:

Comparing the variability of monthly sales between two store branches.



---

4. Chi-Square Test

âœ… Correct Information:

Used to test for independence or association between two categorical variables.

Also used for goodness-of-fit tests to assess how well sample data matches expected distribution.


âœ… Example Use Case:

Testing if gender and voting preference are independent.



---

5. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

âœ… Correct Information:

ANOVA is an application of the F-distribution.

Used to compare means of more than two groups.

Requires assumptions of normality and equal variances (homogeneity of variance).


âœ… Example Use Case:

Comparing average test scores among students from three different schools.



---

Conclusion:

âœ… The notes are correct but can benefit from minor clarifications:

Z-Test â†’ Best for large samples where Ïƒ is known.

T-Test â†’ Best for small samples or when Ïƒ is unknown.

F-Test â†’ Often paired with ANOVA for variance checks.

Chi-Square â†’ For categorical data relationships.

ANOVA â†’ For comparing multiple group means.

Examples of Type I and Type II Errors in the Banking Industry

In the context of hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors are critical concepts that directly impact decision-making in banking operations, fraud detection, and risk management.


---

Type I Error (False Positive)

Definition: Rejecting a true null hypothesis.

Impact: You incorrectly conclude that an effect exists when it actually does not.


Example in Banking (Type I Error):

Fraud Detection System

Null Hypothesis (): The transaction is not fraudulent.

Alternate Hypothesis (): The transaction is fraudulent.


ðŸ’¬ Type I Error Scenario:
The bank's fraud detection system incorrectly flags a legitimate transaction as fraudulent.
âœ… Result: The bank may block a valid customer's account or decline a genuine transaction.

Impact in Banking:

Inconvenience to customers.

Potentially lost revenue if the customer moves to another bank.

Damaged customer trust.



---

Type II Error (False Negative)

Definition: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.

Impact: You incorrectly conclude that no effect exists when one actually does.


Example in Banking (Type II Error):

Loan Default Prediction

Null Hypothesis (): The customer will not default on their loan.

Alternate Hypothesis (): The customer will default on their loan.


ðŸ’¬ Type II Error Scenario:
The bankâ€™s credit risk model fails to identify a high-risk borrower, incorrectly classifying them as low-risk.
âœ… Result: The bank approves a loan for someone who ends up defaulting.

Impact in Banking:

Financial loss from unpaid loans.

Increased credit risk exposure.

Negative impact on financial reserves and capital adequacy.



---

Key Differences in Impact:


---

Real-World Examples in Banking Operations

âœ… Type I Error: A bank incorrectly freezes a customerâ€™s credit card after a large but legitimate overseas purchase.
âœ… Type II Error: The bank fails to detect a fraudster using stolen card details, allowing multiple transactions.


---

Mitigation Strategies

Use threshold tuning to balance Type I and Type II error trade-offs.

Implement machine learning models with optimized sensitivity and specificity.

Use ensemble techniques like Random Forest or XGBoost to improve prediction accuracy.
